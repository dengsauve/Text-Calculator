# Text Calculator

For those who cannot read or interpret numerical characters,
this is a calculator that displays input and results as words.

For some context, in an episode of [Science Friday](https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/man-couldnt-see-numbers/)
a topic of conversation was of a patient who could not see numerical characters 2-9 as a result of a neurological 
disorder. This man had developed his own short hand for performing mathematical computation, 
but it got me thinking about a simple text based calculator. 

I was surprised to find nothing like it online. So I decided to make one.
